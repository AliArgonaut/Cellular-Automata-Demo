# Cellular-Automata-Demo
Here is a version of Conways Game of Life in python using the pygame library. The cellular automata behave exactly as described in Conway's Game of Life. The grid is a bit large, maybe I will go in later and make the playing field larger, so that more cellular automata cna exist and interact.
